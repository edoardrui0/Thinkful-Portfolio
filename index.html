          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <!-- there's a link to one of my most recent projects, which opens to a new tab. I made it to help out my church. My project does use React, feel free to look at it, any criticism is welcomed  -->
          <p>
            I learned about web development through a good friend of mine and I
            became instantly hooked. I always found it interesting, challenging
            and rewarding. I actively try to learn new things and always
            continue to challenge myself to be better. Feel free to take a look
            at my most recent project
            <a href="#territory">here</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Besides coding, I enjoy making music, fishing, collecting sneakers,
            and drifting cars. I feel my hobbies help me take inspriration from
            the real world and put it into the tech world.
          </p>
          <p>
            Teamwork is something that I highly value. Working with a team is
            very rewarding, as you get to learn and rely on one another. Setting
            a culture in the office has always been important, and that
            definitely something I will bring to the table.

          <p>
            A small webapp that I built to help my congregation when it comes to
            managing our territory. Currently the site is a bit broken, but all
            the logic is there. I used React mostly to build this webapp. Please
            feel free to look at the GitHub repo
